v1.2.2 - build_001

v1.2.1 - Build_003 
--------------------
+ Added ability to use an alternate key-binding for the gui trigger in the options settings.
  User can now select "use alternate keybinding" in options, this will use what is specified
  in the config file under <AlternateKeyBindingCode></AlternateKeyBindingCode>
  The setting takes up to 3 values seperated by commas. The first two MUST be set.
  So "LeftControl,Keypad9" is valid, so is "LeftShift,LeftAlt,Q". Case matters, don't use spaces.
  Standard unity keybinding names are used, you can find them on the Unity website or via google.
  http://docs.unity3d.com/400/Documentation/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html
  They are processed in order and each requires the preceeding to be pressed.
  So if you set "LeftControl,Keypad9" then hitting keypad9 and then LeftControl will usually not work.
  When using three in the combo, note unity is a little twitchy in that you can hold the first down, but then
  you ususally need to tap the second and third at basically the exact same time.

~ Changed text of Show CTRL+L Gui to  Show Gui  (CTRL+L).. more logical.
